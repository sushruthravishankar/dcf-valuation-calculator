# DCF Valuation Calculator

This project is a Python-based tool to calculate the enterprise value of a company using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation method.

## How It Works
- Takes projected Free Cash Flows (FCFs) for 5 years
- Inputs WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital)
- Inputs a Terminal Growth Rate
- Discounts cash flows and terminal value
- Outputs Enterprise Value

## Technologies
- Python 3.10

## Example Inputs
- Projected FCFs: [10000, 10500, 11000, 11500, 12000]
- WACC: 8%
- Terminal Growth Rate: 2.5%

## Example Outputs
- Discounted FCFs
- Discounted Terminal Value
- Enterprise Value
